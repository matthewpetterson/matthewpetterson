### Hi, I'm Matt
 
I am a software developer who has been working in the Java space for the last 12 years, primarly on CRM based web applications. Out side of the development world I am extremely passionate about the natural world and I am currently studying towards my FGASA Level 1 qualification which I plan on using for part time field guiding.

#### Currently experimenting with:
* Flutter (particularly for Web instead of Android/iOS)
